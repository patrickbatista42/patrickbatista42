# Hi, I'm Patrick! üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I am a technology enthusiast and a Master's student in Applied Artificial Intelligence at UFSC, with a solid background in Aerospace Engineering. My passion lies at the intersection of complex algorithms and practical applications that can transform the world. In my master's program, I am focusing my studies on the **application of Computer Vision and Machine Learning for human movement analysis and assessment, specifically targeting the identification and correction of physical exercise execution.** After a few years focused on other areas, I am redirecting my career and deepening my knowledge in programming, with a special focus on AI, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## üîß My Projects

Here you will find some of the projects I have worked on or am currently working on. More details and source code can be found in their respective repositories!

* **(Master's Research in Development) AI for Analysis and Evaluation of Physical Exercise Execution:**
    * **Description:** This master's project aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence-based system for identifying different gym exercises and evaluating the quality of their execution. The approach will involve using Computer Vision techniques to extract movement data from videos (e.g., *human pose estimation*) and developing Machine Learning/Deep Learning models to classify movements and provide feedback on form.
    * **Main Objective:** To develop methodologies for kinematic analysis and postural correction assessment in exercises, aiming to optimize workouts and prevent injuries.
    * **Key Technologies and Concepts (planned/under study):** Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe (or alternatives for *pose estimation* like OpenPose, Detectron2), TensorFlow/PyTorch (for models like 1D/3D CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers), time series analysis, action classification.
    * **Status:** Initial phase of literature review and detailed scope definition with academic supervision.
    * **Repository:** Soon
